To set up the material in Unity 5 do the following:

First of rescale the textures for your liking, I do not recommend using 4k textures for a game but its up to you.
Import the textures with your desired texture resulution.

Connect "TEXTURENAME_Albedo" to "Albedo"
Connect "TEXTURENAME_MetallicSmoothness" to "Metallic"
Connect "TEXTURENAME_Normal" to "Normal Map"*


* When loading the normal map into the material you might get a popup under it saying "This texture is not marked as normal map"
make sure you click the button "Fix Now" or go into the texture and make sure it's marked as a normal map.
